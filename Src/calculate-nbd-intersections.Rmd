# Use code similar to calculate-cd-intersections
 
This program will calculate which census blocks intersect with which neighborhoods. It relies on information stored in

+ bg.RData
+ bl.RData
+ nbd.RData

### General information

For information about various files, refer to the files that stored the relevant data (e.g., store_block_information.Rmd).

It helps to know the FIPS (Federal Information Processing System) codes for Kansas (20) and Missouri (29).

The important counties for this program are

Cass County, MO (29037)
Clay County, MO (29047)
Jackson County, MO (29095)
Johnson County, KS (20091)
Leavenworth County, KS (20103)
Wyandotte County, KS (20209)

### Load relevant files

```{r setup}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
path_name <- "../data/"
load(paste0(path_name, "bg", ".RData"))
load(paste0(path_name, "bl", ".RData"))
load(paste0(path_name, "nbd", ".RData"))
```

### Intersect blocks and neighborhoods

Identify the list of all blocks that partially or completely intersect with any neighborhood. Calculate the block area and add it back to the data frame.

```{r intersect-bl}
bl                                     %>%
  st_intersection(nbd)                  -> bl_nbd_intersection

bl_nbd_intersection                    %>%
  st_area                              %>%
  as.numeric                           %>%
  tibble                               %>%
  set_names("in_area")                 %>%
  bind_cols(bl_nbd_intersection)       %>%
  mutate(
    bg_id=str_sub(bl_id, 1, 12))       %>%
  mutate(
    bl_prop_in=in_area/bl_area)        %>%
  mutate(
    bl_prop_in=round(bl_prop_in, 3))   %>%
  select(
    bg_id,
    bl_id, 
    nbd_id, 
    bl_prop_in)                         -> bl_nbd_intersection
```


### Intersect block groups and neighborhoods

Identify the list of all block groups that partially or completely intersect with any neighborhood.

```{r intersect-bg}
bg                                     %>%
  st_intersection(nbd)                 -> bg_nbd_intersection

bg_nbd_intersection                    %>%
  st_area                              %>%
  as.numeric                           %>%
  tibble                               %>%
  set_names("in_area")                 %>%
  bind_cols(bg_nbd_intersection)       %>%
  mutate(bg_prop_in=in_area/bg_area)   %>%
  select(
    bg_id,
    nbd_id, 
    bg_prop_in)                         -> bg_nbd_intersection
```

### Save the information in an RData file.

```{r save}
save(
  bl_nbd_intersection,
  bg_nbd_intersection,
  file="../Data/nbd-intersections.RData")
```
