This program will calculate which census blocks intersect with which community districts. It relies on information stored in

+ tr.RData
+ bg.RData
+ bl.RData
+ cd.RData

### General information

For information about various files, refer to the files that stored the relevant data (e.g., store_block_information.Rmd).

It helps to know the FIPS (Federal Information Processing System) codes for Kansas (20) and Missouri (29).

The important counties for this program are

Cass County, MO (29037)
Clay County, MO (29047)
Jackson County, MO (29095)
Johnson County, KS (20091)
Leavenworth County, KS (20103)
Wyandotte County, KS (20209)

### Load relevant files

```{r setup}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
path_name <- "../data/"
load(paste0(path_name, "tr", ".RData"))
load(paste0(path_name, "bg", ".RData"))
load(paste0(path_name, "bl", ".RData"))
load(paste0(path_name, "cd", ".RData"))
```

### Intersect blocks and community districts

Identify the list of all blocks that partially or completely intersect with any community district. Calculate the block area and add it back to the data frame.

```{r intersect-bl}
bl                                     %>%
  st_intersection(cd)                  -> bl_cd_intersection

bl_cd_intersection                     %>%
  st_area                              %>%
  as.numeric                           %>%
  tibble                               %>%
  set_names("in_area")                 %>%
  bind_cols(bl_cd_intersection)        %>%
  mutate(
    tr_id=str_sub(bl_id, 1, 11))       %>%
  mutate(
    bg_id=str_sub(bl_id, 1, 12))       %>%
  mutate(
    bl_prop_in=in_area/bl_area)        %>%
  mutate(
    bl_prop_in=round(bl_prop_in, 3))   %>%
  select(
    tr_id,
    bg_id,
    bl_id, 
    cd_id, 
    bl_prop_in)                         -> bl_cd_intersection
```


### Intersect block groups and community districts

Identify the list of all block groups that partially or completely intersect with any community district.

```{r intersect-bg}
bg                                     %>%
  st_intersection(cd)                   -> bg_cd_intersection

bg_cd_intersection                     %>%
  st_area                              %>%
  as.numeric                           %>%
  tibble                               %>%
  set_names("in_area")                 %>%
  bind_cols(bg_cd_intersection)        %>%
  mutate(bg_prop_in=in_area/bg_area)   %>%
  select(
    bg_id,
    cd_id, 
    bg_prop_in)                         -> bg_cd_intersection
```

### Intersect tracts and community districts

Identify the list of all tracts that partially or completely intersect with any community district.

```{r intersect-tr}
tr                                     %>%
  st_intersection(cd)                   -> tr_cd_intersection

tr_cd_intersection                     %>%
  st_area                              %>%
  as.numeric                           %>%
  tibble                               %>%
  set_names("in_area")                 %>%
  bind_cols(tr_cd_intersection)        %>%
  mutate(tr_prop_in=in_area/tr_area)   %>%
  select(
    tr_id,
    cd_id, 
    tr_prop_in)                         -> tr_cd_intersection
```

### Save the information in an RData file.

```{r save}
save(
  bl_cd_intersection,
  bg_cd_intersection,
  tr_cd_intersection,
  file="../Data/cd-intersections.RData")
```
