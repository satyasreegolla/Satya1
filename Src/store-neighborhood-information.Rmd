This program will read in shapefiles for neighborhoods in the Kansas City metropolitan area, convert them into the simple features (sf) format, and store the results for later use.

### General information

An email from Neal Wilson, dated 2022-03-03 and found in the doc folder, outlines some of the details about the origins of this file. It was originally sent in an email dated 2021-10-04.

### Read neighboorhood shapefiles


```{r setup}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
path_name <- "../data"
```

```{r read}
file_name <- "nbd/Neighborhoods.shp"
path_name                                %>%
  paste(file_name, sep="/")              %>%
  st_read(stringsAsFactors=FALSE)         -> shape1
head(shape1) 
shape1                                   %>%
  ggplot()                                +
      geom_sf(aes())                      +
      ggtitle(file_name)
```

### Align coordinate reference system

Use the same coordinate reference system that is found in the U.S. Census Bureau's shapefiles.

```{r align}
load("../Data/bl.RData")
shape1                                   %>%
  mutate(label=AreaName)                 %>%
  st_transform(crs=st_crs(bl))            -> nbd
```

### Store as an RData file

Placing the file in an RData format will speed up future use of this file.

```{r store-counties}
save(nbd, file="../Data/nbd.RData")
```
