This program examines mismatches between census blocks shape files and redistricting files.

### General information

The starting point for downloading most Census shapefiles is [here][c_general]. You can find more about the census redistricting files [here][c_redistricting]. 

It helps to know the FIPS (Federal Information Processing System) codes for Kansas (20) and Missouri (29).

The important counties for this program are

Cass County, MO (29037)
Clay County, MO (29047)
Jackson County, MO (29095)
Johnson County, KS (20091)
Leavenworth County, KS (20103)
Platte County, MO (29165)
Wyandotte County, KS (20209)

### Load relevant files

```{r setup}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
path_name <- "../Data/"
load(paste0(path_name, "bl", ".RData"))
glimpse(bl)
load(paste0(path_name, "red", ".RData"))
glimpse(red)
```

### Calculate mismatches

Do a full join of bl and red. Mismatches are coded as 
+ m_code=0 perfect match
+ m_code=1 not found in red
+ m_code=2 not found in bl
  
  

```{r mismatch}
bl                                    %>%
  full_join(red, by=c("bl_id"))       %>%
  mutate(
    m_red=
      as.numeric(is.na(people)))      %>%
  mutate(
    m_bl=as.numeric(is.na(bl_name)))  %>%
  mutate(m_code=m_red+2*m_bl)          -> m
m %>%
  group_by(m_code)                    %>%
  summarize(n=n())                    %>%
  print
m                                     %>%
  filter(m_code > 0)                  %>%
  print
```

There are no mismatches.
