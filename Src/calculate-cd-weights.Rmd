This program will calculate which census blocks intersect with which community districts. It relies on information stored in

+ bg.RData
+ bl.RData
+ cd.RData
+ cd-intersections.RData
+ red.RData

### General information

For information about various files, refer to the files that stored the relevant data (e.g., store_block_information.Rmd).

It helps to know the FIPS (Federal Information Processing System) codes for Kansas (20) and Missouri (29).

The important counties for this program are

Cass County, MO (29037)
Clay County, MO (29047)
Jackson County, MO (29095)
Johnson County, KS (20091)
Leavenworth County, KS (20103)
Wyandotte County, KS (20209)

### Setup

```{r setup}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
path_name <- "../data/"
```

### Load key files

Tracts

```{r load-tr}
load(paste0(path_name, "tr", ".RData"))
glimpse(tr)
```

Block groups

```{r load-bg}
load(paste0(path_name, "bg", ".RData"))
glimpse(bg)
```

Blocks

```{r load-bl}
load(paste0(path_name, "bl", ".RData"))
glimpse(bl)
```

Community districts

```{r load-cd}
load(paste0(path_name, "cd", ".RData"))
glimpse(cd)
```

Community district intersections

```{r load-cd-intersections}
load(paste0(path_name, "cd-intersections", ".RData"))
glimpse(tr_cd_intersection)
glimpse(bg_cd_intersection)
glimpse(bl_cd_intersection)
```

```{r load-redistricting}
load(paste0(path_name, "red", ".RData"))
glimpse(red)
```

### Counts

```{r display-nice-counts}
# This code will compute the count of a vector
# and display it with commas if it is greater
# than 999.
nice_count <- function(x) {
  x                                    %>%
    unique                             %>%
    length                             %>%
    format(big.mark=",")
}
```
There are 7 counties in the Kansas City metropolitan area.

There are `r nice_count(cd$cd_id)` community districts in the 7 counties.

There are 
`r nice_count(tr$tr_id)`
tracts in the 7 counties. 
`r nice_count(tr_cd_intersection$tr_id)`
of these intersect partially or completely with one or more community districts.

There are 
`r nice_count(bg$bg_id)`
block groups in the 7 counties. 
`r nice_count(bg_cd_intersection$bg_id)`
of these intersect partially or completely with one or more community districts.

There are 
`r nice_count(bl$bl_id)`
blocks in the 7 counties. 
`r nice_count(bl_cd_intersection$bl_id)` 
of these intersect partially or completely with one or more community districts.

### Get tract list

Identify the list of all tracts that partially or completely intersect with any community district.

```{r intersect-tr}
tr_cd_intersection                     %>%
  pull(tr_id)                          %>%
  unique                                -> tr_list
glimpse(tr_list)
```

### Get block group list

Identify the list of all block groups that partially or completely intersect with any community district.

```{r intersect-bg}
bg_cd_intersection                     %>%
  pull(bg_id)                          %>%
  unique                                -> bg_list
glimpse(bg_list)
```

### Get block list

Now get a list of all census blocks that lie inside any of these block groups. Merge with red to get population and housing unit counts.

```{r pull-blocks}
bl                                     %>%
  pull(bl_id)                          %>%
  str_sub(1, 11)                       %>%
  bind_cols(bl$bl_id)                  %>%
  set_names(c("tr_id", "bl_id"))       %>%
  
  filter(tr_id %in% tr_list)           %>%
  inner_join(red, 
    by=c("tr_id", "bl_id"))               -> bl_list
glimpse(bl_list)
```

### Calculate counts and areas of intersections

```{r calculate-proportions}
bl_cd_intersection                     %>%
  full_join(bl_list, 
    by=c("tr_id", "bg_id", "bl_id"))   %>%
  replace_na(list(bl_prop_in=0))       %>%
  replace_na(list(cd_id=0))            %>%
  mutate(
    people_in=
      round(people*bl_prop_in))        %>%
  mutate(
    units_in=
      round(units*bl_prop_in))         %>%
  select(
    tr_id,
    bg_id,
    bl_id,
    cd_id,
    bl_prop_in,
    people,
    people_in,
    units,
    units_in)                           -> bl_counts

glimpse(bl_counts)
```

### Calculate counts for block groups

```{r count-bl}
red                                    %>%
  group_by(bg_id)                      %>%
  summarize(
    people=sum(people),
    units=sum(units))                   -> count_total
glimpse(count_total)

bl_counts                              %>%
  group_by(tr_id, bg_id, cd_id)        %>%
  summarize(
    people_in=sum(people_in),
    units_in=sum(units_in))            %>%
  filter(cd_id > 0)                     -> count_in
glimpse(count_in)

count_in                               %>%
  inner_join(count_total, by="bg_id")  %>%
  filter(cd_id > 0)                     -> bg_counts
glimpse(bg_counts)
```

### Calculate counts for tracts

```{r count-tr}
red                                    %>%
  group_by(tr_id)                      %>%
  summarize(
    people=sum(people),
    units=sum(units))                   -> count_total
glimpse(count_total)

bl_counts                              %>%
  group_by(tr_id, cd_id)               %>%
  summarize(
    people_in=sum(people_in),
    units_in=sum(units_in))            %>%
  filter(cd_id > 0)                     -> count_in
glimpse(count_in)

count_in                               %>%
  inner_join(count_total, by="tr_id")  %>%
  filter(cd_id > 0)                     -> tr_counts
glimpse(tr_counts)
```

### Save the information in an RData file.

```{r save}
save(
  tr_counts,
  tr_list,
  bg_counts,
  bg_list,
  bl_counts,
  bl_list,
  file="../Data/cd-weights.RData")
```
