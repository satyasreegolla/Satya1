This program will calculate weights for block groups 
to allow extrapolation to community districts.

This program uses

+ bg.RData
+ bl.RData
+ cd.RData
+ cd-intersections.RData
+ red.RData

### General information

For information about various files, refer to the files that stored the relevant data (e.g., store_block_information.Rmd).

It helps to know the FIPS (Federal Information Processing System) codes for Kansas (20) and Missouri (29).

The important counties for this program are

Cass County, MO (29037)
Clay County, MO (29047)
Jackson County, MO (29095)
Johnson County, KS (20091)
Leavenworth County, KS (20103)
Wyandotte County, KS (20209)

### Setup

```{r setup}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
path_name <- "../data/"
```

### Load key files

Tracts

```{r load-tr}
load(paste0(path_name, "tr", ".RData"))
glimpse(tr)
```

Block groups

```{r load-bg}
load(paste0(path_name, "bg", ".RData"))
glimpse(bg)
```

Blocks

```{r load-bl}
load(paste0(path_name, "bl", ".RData"))
glimpse(bl)
```

Community districts

```{r load-cd}
load(paste0(path_name, "cd", ".RData"))
glimpse(cd)
```

Community district intersections

```{r load-cd-intersections}
load(paste0(path_name, "cd-intersections", ".RData"))
glimpse(tr_cd_intersection)
glimpse(bg_cd_intersection)
glimpse(bl_cd_intersection)
```

Redistricting information

The redistricting files provide counts of 
people and housing units for individual
Census blocks.

```{r load-redistricting}
load(paste0(path_name, "red", ".RData"))
glimpse(red)
```

### Counts

```{r display-nice-counts}
# This code will compute the count of a vector
# and display it with commas if it is greater
# than 999.
nice_count <- function(x) {
  x                                    %>%
    unique                             %>%
    length                             %>%
    format(big.mark=",")
}
```
There are 7 counties in the Kansas City metropolitan area.

There are `r nice_count(cd$cd_id)` community districts in the 7 counties.

There are 
`r nice_count(tr$tr_id)`
tracts in the 7 counties. 
`r nice_count(tr_cd_intersection$tr_id)`
of these intersect partially or completely with one or more community districts.

There are 
`r nice_count(bg$bg_id)`
block groups in the 7 counties. 
`r nice_count(bg_cd_intersection$bg_id)`
of these intersect partially or completely with one or more community districts.

There are 
`r nice_count(bl$bl_id)`
blocks in the 7 counties. 
`r nice_count(bl_cd_intersection$bl_id)` 
of these intersect partially or completely with one or more community districts.

### Get tract list

Identify the list of all tracts that partially or completely intersect with any community district.

```{r intersect-tr}
tr_cd_intersection                     %>%
  pull(tr_id)                          %>%
  unique                                -> tr_list
glimpse(tr_list)
```

### Get block group list

Identify the list of all block groups that partially or completely intersect with any community district.

```{r intersect-bg}
bg_cd_intersection                     %>%
  pull(bg_id)                          %>%
  unique                                -> bg_list
glimpse(bg_list)
```

### Get block list

Now get a list of all census blocks that lie inside any of these block groups. Merge with red to get population and housing unit counts.

```{r pull-blocks}
bl                                     %>%
  pull(bl_id)                          %>%
  str_sub(1, 11)                       %>%
  bind_cols(bl$bl_id)                  %>%
  set_names(c("tr_id", "bl_id"))       %>%
  
  filter(tr_id %in% tr_list)           %>%
  inner_join(red, 
    by=c("tr_id", "bl_id"))               -> bl_list
glimpse(bl_list)
```

### Calculate counts and areas of intersections

Tracts and/or block groups that like entirely
inside a community district get full weight.
This is either the number of people or the
number of housing units, depending on which
measure from ACS we are using.

Tracts and block groups that lie only partially
inside a community district get partial weight.

We calculate the partial weight by adding up the
number of people or housing units in a Census block
within a tract or block group only when it
lies entirely inside a community district.
We do not count people or housing units for a 
Census block that lies entirely outside a community
district. There are a small number of Census 
blocks that lie partially inside a community
district. For these, we allocate proportionally
to the area inside the community district.


```{r calculate-proportions}
bl_cd_intersection                     %>%
  full_join(bl_list, 
    by=c("tr_id", "bg_id", "bl_id"))   %>%
  replace_na(list(bl_prop_in=0))       %>%
  replace_na(list(cd_id=0))            %>%
  mutate(
    people_in=
      round(people*bl_prop_in))        %>%
  mutate(
    units_in=
      round(units*bl_prop_in))         %>%
  select(
    tr_id,
    bg_id,
    bl_id,
    cd_id,
    bl_prop_in,
    people,
    people_in,
    units,
    units_in)                           -> bl_counts

glimpse(bl_counts)
```

### Calculate counts for block groups

```{r count-bl}
red                                    %>%
  group_by(bg_id)                      %>%
  summarize(
    people=sum(people),
    units=sum(units))                   -> count_total
glimpse(count_total)

bl_counts                              %>%
  group_by(tr_id, bg_id, cd_id)        %>%
  summarize(
    people_in=sum(people_in),
    units_in=sum(units_in))            %>%
  filter(cd_id > 0)                     -> count_in
glimpse(count_in)

count_in                               %>%
  inner_join(count_total, by="bg_id")  %>%
  filter(cd_id > 0)                     -> bg_counts
glimpse(bg_counts)
```

### Calculate counts for tracts

```{r count-tr}
red                                    %>%
  group_by(tr_id)                      %>%
  summarize(
    people=sum(people),
    units=sum(units))                   -> count_total
glimpse(count_total)

bl_counts                              %>%
  group_by(tr_id, cd_id)               %>%
  summarize(
    people_in=sum(people_in),
    units_in=sum(units_in))            %>%
  filter(cd_id > 0)                     -> count_in
glimpse(count_in)

count_in                               %>%
  inner_join(count_total, by="tr_id")  %>%
  filter(cd_id > 0)                     -> tr_counts
glimpse(tr_counts)
```

### Save the information in an RData file.

```{r save}
save(
  tr_counts,
  tr_list,
  bg_counts,
  bg_list,
  bl_counts,
  bl_list,
  file="../Data/cd-weights.RData")
```
